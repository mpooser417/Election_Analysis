# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes which candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources
* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
* There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
* The candidates were:
  * Charles Casper Stockham
  * Diana DeGette
  * Raymon Anthony Doane
* The candidate results were:
  * Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  * Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
* The winner of the election was:
  * Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections recently requested an audit of the recent local congressional election. In this audit, they wanted the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates with votes and the total number and percentage of votes they received. In addition, the county with the highest voter turnout and the winner of the election based on the popular vote was wanted as well.
## Challenge Results
The analysis of the election showed that:
* There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
* The candidates were:
  * Charles Casper Stockham receiving 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
  * Diana DeGette receiving 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
  * Raymon Anthony Doane receiving 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
* The county turnout was:
  * Jefferson County making up for 10.5% of the votes with 38,855 votes.
  * Arapahoe County making up for 6.7% of the votes with 24,801 votes.
  * Denver County making up for 82.8% of the votes with 306,055 votes.
* The winner of the election was:
  * Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 total votes.
* The county with the highest voter turnout was:
  *  Denver County which had 82.8% of the votes and 306,055 total votes.
## Challenge Summary
This Python script could be used to determine these same outcomes for any upcoming election. The only change in the script would be the file that is used for the incoming data and the file for the output data of the file. Additonal analysis code that could be added to the script would be code to determine the winner based on popular votes in each county as well as code that would determine the percentage of votes that candidates received from each county.
